/// A CRDT for text.
///
/// Like all other text CRDTs it allows multiple peers on a distributed
/// network to concurrently edit the same text document, making sure that they
/// all converge to the same final state without relying on a central server to
/// coordinate the edits.
///
/// However, unlike many other CRDTs, a `Replica` doesn't actually store the
/// text contents itself. This allows to decouple the text buffer from the CRDT
/// machinery needed to handle concurrent edits and guarantee convergence.
///
/// Put another way, a `Replica` is a pure CRDT that doesn't know anything
/// about where the text is actually stored. This is great because it makes it
/// very easy to use it together with any text data structure of your choice:
/// simple `String`s, gap buffers, piece tables, ropes, etc.
///
/// # How to distribute `Replica`s between peers.
///
/// When starting a new collaborative editing session, the first peer
/// initializes its `Replica` via the [`new`](Self::new) method,
/// [`encode`](Self::encode)s it and sends the result to the other peers in the
/// session. If a new peer joins the session later on, one of the peers already
/// in the session can [`encode`](Self::encode) their `Replica` and send it to
/// them.
///
/// # How to integrate remote edits.
///
/// Every time a peer performs an edit on their local buffer they must inform
/// their `Replica` by calling either [`inserted`](Self::inserted) or
/// [`deleted`](Self::deleted). This produces [`Insertion`]s and [`Deletion`]s
/// which can be sent over to the other peers using the network layer of your
/// choice.
///
/// When a peer receives a remote `Insertion` or `Deletion` they can integrate
/// it into their own `Replica` by calling either
/// [`integrate_insertion`](Self::integrate_insertion) or
/// [`integrate_deletion`](Self::integrate_deletion), respectively. The output
/// of those methods tells the peer *where* in their local buffer they should
/// apply the edit, taking into account all the other edits that have happened
/// concurrently.
///
/// Basically, you tell your `Replica` how your buffer changes, and it tells
/// you how your buffer *should* change when receiving remote edits.
